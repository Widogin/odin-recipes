    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pappa al Pomodoro is a delicious and light soup made of tomato and bread, you can enjoy it hot or cold. It's a peasant-origin dish from Tuscany, used to recycle leftover bread and have a good and healthy meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Canned tomatoes (800 g)</li>
            <li>Bread (300 g)</li>
            <li>Water (to taste)</li>
            <li>Garlic (1 clove)</li>
            <li>Basil to taste</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil (to taste)</li>
            <li>Fine salt (to taste)</li>
        </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat gently some oil in a saucepan</li>
            <li>Peel the garlic and cut it into thin slices (if you don't like it, you can use it whole and unpeeled and remove it later) and fry lightly </li>
            <li>Pour in the tomato pulp and a bit of salt </li>
            <li>Let it cook gently for a generous half hour</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cut the bread into slices and cut them in half </li>
            <li>When the sauce is ready, dilute it with some water and mix</li>
            <li>Immerse the bread slices, breaking them up if necessary so as to fit them all in the pot</li>
            <li>Press down lightly with the ladle</li>
            <li>Cover with a lid</li>
            <li>Let it rest for about 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Mix well and put it back on the stove and let it cook gently for another 5 minutes or until the desired consistency is reached: the bread slices must completely disintegrate and create a "pulp"</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and adjust the salt, then finish with a generous drizzle of oil and a few basil leaves</li>
            <li>Mix well and serve hot, warm, or cold, garnishing the dish with an additional drizzle of oil</li>
        </ol>
