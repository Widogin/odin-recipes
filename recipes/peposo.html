    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Peposo is a Tuscan recipe, similar to a stew. The meat is cooked in wine, from whom it will take on a dark color and will be much spicier thanks to the addition of black pepper.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Priest's hat (1400 g)</li>
            <li>Red wine (500 g)</li>
            <li>Black peppercorns (to taste)</li>
            <li>Garlic (4 cloves)</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil (to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the peppercorns in a gauze and make a little package by closing it with string</li>
            <li>Now move on to the meat, first cut it into slices about 3 cm thick and then into 4cm long strips (Do not trim the fat from the meat, unless it is excessive)</li>
            <li>Place a pan, preferably cast iron, on the heat, add the meat, the peeled garlic cloves and the gauze with the pepper: Mix</li>
            <li>Cook the meat for at least 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Then pour in the red wine and cover with the lid: Leave to cook on low heat for 2 hours</li>
            <li>Then remove the lid and season with salt, mix and leave to cook for another 2 hours on a low flame, stirring occasionally</li>
            <li>When the sauce has reduced, remove the gauze with the pepper, taste the meat to check if it is cooked, if necessary add salt and serve</li>
